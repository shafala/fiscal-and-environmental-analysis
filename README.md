# Statistical Analysis: Fiscal Policy & CO₂ Emissions

This repository contains two statistical reports prepared in Excel as part of an academic project in statistics.

## 📊 Report 1: Deficits, Discipline, and Design
**A Statistical Comparison of UK and Luxembourg Fiscal Policy (2007–2022)**  
This analysis compares fiscal balances between the UK and Luxembourg, highlighting:
- Variations in fiscal discipline and volatility
- Statistical tests (t-test, F-test)
- Data sourced from OECD

**Key Findings:**
- The UK consistently ran deficits (avg. -5.86% of GDP)
- Luxembourg maintained surpluses (avg. +1.20%)
- Differences in fiscal volatility reflect structural economic contrasts

## 🌍 Report 2: CO₂ Emissions and GDP Growth
**An investigation into the relationship between emissions and economic growth (182 countries)**  
This report explores whether higher CO₂ emissions intensity correlates with GDP growth.

**Key Findings:**
- Weak but statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.17, p = 0.02)
- No strong association found via Chi-square test
- Suggests that other factors beyond emissions influence growth
